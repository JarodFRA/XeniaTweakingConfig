So First of all.

I'm not the original creator of Xenia. I just make some mods about optimisations and unique stability on certain games. Please ensure that some of theses "xenia-canary.config.toml" can just not work correctly for you. 
If that's the case, just use the base "xenia-canary.config.toml" of Xenia Canary.
